# Workbench

Workbench is a desktop app built on [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) aimed to allow end-users to combine their suite of tools they use during their everyday workflow, all into one location.


## Installation

Use the package manager [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) to install Workbench.

```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

Workbench uses a modular approach, meaning functionality is loaded only on an as-need basis. 
Not using the chat? Don't load the module and the features won't be there!


## Contributing
I am constantly looking for help with finding bugs, and coming up with ideas for new features and modules!
